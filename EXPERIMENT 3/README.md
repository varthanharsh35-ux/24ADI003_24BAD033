Topic: Multilinear Regression — Student Academic Performance Prediction

What it does: Loads the student performance dataset, performs preprocessing and encoding of categorical features, computes the target variable as the average of Math, Reading, and Writing scores, handles missing values using imputation, applies feature scaling, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a Multilinear Regression model, predicts student exam scores, evaluates performance using MSE, RMSE, and R² Score, analyzes regression coefficients to interpret feature influence, and optimizes the model using feature elimination, Ridge regression, and Lasso regularization.

Visualizations include predicted vs actual score comparison, coefficient magnitude plots, and residual distribution analysis.

Topic: Polynomial Regression — Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Prediction

What it does: Loads the Auto MPG dataset, cleans and handles missing values, selects horsepower as the independent variable and MPG as the target variable, generates polynomial features for degrees 2, 3, and 4, applies feature scaling, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains Polynomial Regression models for different degrees, evaluates performance using MSE, RMSE, and R² Score, compares model performance across polynomial degrees, and applies Ridge regression to reduce overfitting.

Visualizations include polynomial curve fitting for different degrees, training vs testing error comparison, and bias-variance demonstration.
