SCENARIO 1

SMS Spam Classification (Multinomial Naïve Bayes)

This scenario implements Multinomial Naïve Bayes to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham. The dataset is loaded and basic preprocessing such as converting text to lowercase and removing special characters is performed. The text data is converted into numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization. The target labels are encoded and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained using the training data and predictions are generated for the test set. Performance is evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a Confusion Matrix. This scenario demonstrates how probabilistic classification works effectively for text-based datasets using word frequency patterns.
